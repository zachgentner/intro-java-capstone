Charles Babbage was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and
mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer.

Babbage is considered by some to be "father of the computer". Babbage is credited with
inventing the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine, that eventually led to
more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are
to be found in Babbage's Analytical Engine, programmed using a principle openly borrowed
from the Jacquard loom. Babbage had a broad range of interests in addition to his work
on computers covered in his 1832 book Economy of Manufactures and Machinery. His varied
work in other fields has led him to be described as "pre-eminent" among the many
polymaths of his century.
